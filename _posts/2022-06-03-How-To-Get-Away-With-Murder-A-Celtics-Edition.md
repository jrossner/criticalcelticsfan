The Boston Celtics took game 1 of the NBA Finals on the Golden State Warriors’ home court. We knew whoever won Game 1 would instantly become the favorites to win the series. While I maintain the Celtics should win this series in 6 games. But I caution any Celtics fans who now expect the Celtics to be holding the Larry O’Brien by June 14th.

## Game 1 Review
The Warriors hit 19 of their 45 three-point attempts: an impressive 42.2% clip, led by Stephen Curry’s 7 of 14 performance, including 6 for 7 in the first quarter. From the field overall, they hit 39 of 88 (44.3%). Their 14 turnovers are nothing to brag about, but many teams have won while turning the ball over more. The Celtics led by 2 at halftime, but the patented Warriors 3rd quarter gave them a healthy 12 point lead. Yet many Celtics fans probably had a conversation like this at the break before the 4th quarter:

</p>

I wouldn’t liken it to a switch getting flipped, because the truth is we could feel it building at the end of the third. It’s true the Celtics’ keeping it close in the first half despite Curry going semi-nuclear felt like a success, but the third quarter was a gut check. After Jordan Poole put the Warriors up 14 with 3:43 to go, the Celtics offense started to click. Derrick White sunk one from deep. Then Horford. Brown finally takes it to the rack again, then White converts two at the foul line. After a quality drive, Rob Williams cleans up Brown’s miss with authority. Two more White free-throws and the Celtics offense is starting to hum but they’re down 12.

__Ever heard the saying “_The best defense is a great offense_”?__

Jaylen Brown starts the 4th by imposing his will. Maybe Isaiah Thomas taught him something about being the King of the Fourth, because besides Game 6 vs the Heat he has been consistently aggressive in the final frame. Brown nails a step-back over Draymond Green for two and every Celtics fan knows he’s on now. Then he sinks a three, before setting up Rob Williams for the alley-oop dunk and a Payton Pritchard jumper on the next trip. Brown has a sloppy lapse in judgment – something we’ve become accustomed to in the playoffs – before nailing another three and converting a layup. Suddenly the deficit is down to 3 with 7:38 to go. It’s a new game. __In 4 minutes and 22 seconds, Brown has directly helped create 14 points__. The Celtics go 9 for 12 from deep in the 4th, and as they heat-up on offense, they turn the heat up on the Warriors on the other end as well. Ultimately, the Warriors looked shocked.

Remember Steph Curry’s look of utter defeat when he smoked the layup in the closing minutes of the quarter?

## The Murder
The Celtics hit 21 of 41 threes. And it wasn’t the prime suspects. Draymond Green pointed out in his postgame presser that White, Horford, Pritchard, and Smart went 17 for 26 from behind the arc. Prolific efficiency. Their defense was allowed to stay aggressive at the same time due to the refs allowing a level of contact that shrunk the more finesse-styled Warriors. The Celtics never even had a player come close to foul trouble: Derrick White led the team with 3 fouls. They poked loose 7 steals and stuffed 6 shots. All on the road, against a team loaded with players you’d expect to get the benefit of the doubt from the refs.

As Draymond Green put it when asked about how the Warriors can adjust to the supporting Celtics players performance, “you know, we’ll be fine”. He has complete confidence this was an anomaly. That the Celtics couldn’t possibly replicate this performance.

## Who’s To Say
No Celtics fan can responsibly expect White to shoot 62.5% from deep again. And 8 years of Smart has taught us not to expect shooting efficiency anywhere close to the 7 of 11 he shot in Game 1. Not to mention how absurd it is to think Al Horford took __eight threes__.

But the scary reality for the Warriors is that this wasn’t some Hailey’s Comet of Celtics players all performing well at the same time. Jayson Tatum shot a putrid 3 of 17 from the floor, partially hidden by his 13 assists, but Tatum is unlikely to let the Warriors’ defense off the hook like that again. Also consider that Grant Williams (_yes Grant Williams, the same one we wrote about becoming an absolute pain in the ass to have on our team_ <a href=”https://jrossner.github.io/criticalcelticsfan/ecf/playoffs/grant/williams/2022/05/28/Grant-Williams-Who-Do-You-Think-You-Are.html”>Read It Here</a>) Was a non-factor. Actually, he played some ok defense, but was still a __minus 6__ in 16 minutes of action missing one shot from deep and one shot from inside the arc, but collecting 3 rebounds and 3 assists. 

It’s safe to assume Jayson, with some assistance from Grant, should be able to take on some of the scoring load our Game 1 heroes carried. 

## What To Watch in Game 2
### Jordan Poole.
He only added 9 points and 2 assists in 25 minutes of action Thursday, but he had his own run in the last four minutes of the 3rd quarter that put some fear in the heart of Celtics fans. He showed a tremendous ability to create separation with his dribble, and while the play-by-play will only show him draining a deep three, creating an open three for Igoudala, and a couple trips to the charity stripe, if Poole gets any sort of rhythm he could help Steph run this defense ragged and torch them inside and out.

### How the Warriors play Tatum
The Warriors elected to let a single man guard Tatum for most of Game 1, and Celtics forward picked the Warriors apart. If Tatum has even an average shooting night in Game 2, will the Warriors double him and face even more certain death if Tatum continues to show proficiency in finding the open man? Or will they try to make Tatum beat them on their own? It’s always tough to game plan when you lost against a star having a bad shooting night. 

We’ll have to wait for Sunday Night to see.

Go Celts.
