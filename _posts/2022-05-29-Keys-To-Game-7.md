When the season began, even towards the end of the season, the realistic expectations weren't to win an NBA Championship. We all go into the season with the Goal to. And this team has had the talent to for the last 4 years it feels. But who would think this team _should_ win it all this season? As soon as the playoffs started, the goal-posts started getting backed up. Beating the Nets was meaningful, yet now it seems like the bare minimum. Beating the Defending Champions was Mount Everest. Now that its been scaled it's no longer impressive. And now losing to these Miami Heat would be a massive disapointment.

Hopefully these Celtics dont take this moment lightly, and their undefeated streak off losses continues. Lets get to how they can win tonight.

## Game 7 Work-Ons

### Secure the Defensive Boards
Miami had 19 offensive rebounds in game 5, and 11 in game 6. Cs can’t afford to give the Heat second-chance points, and these get the crowd into it. Plus most of these offensive rebounds have been around the basket which is exactly where the Heat prefer to be, as the Celtics cant seem to stay infront of them there.

### Run the Half-Court Offense
The Celtics have been great running their half-court sets. It allows them to hunt mismatches, it allows Ime to have more of an impact. Many of the Cs turnovers have been the result of impatiently taking on multiple defenders in transition. Heat fans will go wild to see their team create turnovers on transition and the Heat have punished Boston in transition with their great finishers.

### Stay Off The Refs
Nothing worse in an elimination game than feeing like resentful refs are making spite calls or non-calls. They will get a call wrong. On the road, against a legitimate team, you can’t afford to play the refs too.
Go Celts.
