The 2021-2022 Celtics have twice jumped out to lead the series in the NBA Finals, and now have fallen behind 2-3 to the Golden State Warriors. After admonishing the Celtics for their poor performances in Boston this postseason, I now _plead_ with them to show a new kind of desperation. Not the kind we’ve seen as they heave terrible threes and blindly offer up the ball in traffic. We need the desperate play of a team that understands most players never get this close to contending for a championship, and most players never get to the Finals again.

If I thought this team responded to disrespect by their opponent, I’d mention Klay Thompson claiming he’d never been this excited to play in Boston. Or Draymond Green’s enduring confidence the Celtics would not be winning a ring this year. Or even the Warriors’ general cockiness about being able to close this series out in Boston before, during, and after Game 5.

We have waived the prospect of becoming legends and writing history in front of these Celtics, and they still look gassed; and even shell-shocked by Warriors runs. Three of the most important Celtics players – Tatum, Brown, and Smart – are also some of the most egotistical players. And on the biggest stage they are shrinking from the opportunity to prove they deserve more accolades, more respect, and above all else which matters to players: more money.

If the Celtics lose Game 6, I feel pessimistic about any chance they have of winning another championship; certainly in another matchup versus the Warriors. We’ve heard endless media sessions with Celtics players praising the Warriors and ogling at the drapings of this event. 

Who wouldn’t be blown away by the seats having “Finals” written on them?

This Game 6 has infinite consequences for the Boston Celtics Franchise going forward. But maybe this pressure is what the Celtics need. We heard all year they love responding to adversity. Maybe a 2-3 hole versus a veteran, accomplished Warriors squad is exactly the adversity they need to play their best. Maybe seeing a confident opponent that just had it’s most complete “team” performance of the series will provoke the Celtics into playing with the edge necessary. This Celtics team has no shot in Game 6 playing with anything but their best. 

Will we see it? You tell me why I should expect it. I ask fellow Celtics fans not to look for excuses right now. I was overcome with doom and gloom in the aftermath of Game 5, as I couldn’t help but theorize that Tatum with a healthy shoulder would hit more of the shots he took. But the excuses have no place in the conversation right now. Every Celtic should be focused on what they _can_ do in Game 6, not what they can’t.

All the usual problems are hampering the Celtics still: turnovers, mental lapses, bad rebounding, and awful shot selection when it matters most. Can the Celtics rectify these for a couple of games? I doubt it. Can they overcome them by catching fire from deep and catching the Warriors on a bad shooting night? Maybe. At this point, it’s what I’m hoping for.

So let’s see it, Celtics. Game 6. In Boston. To stay alive.

Go Celts.
