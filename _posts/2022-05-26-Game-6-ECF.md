We would like to introduce a new section of our posts, “The 20/20” — in honor of the “hindsight is 20/20” saying — to review some keys to the prior game.
### The 20/20
Call Game 5 what you want. A rock fight. A defensive showcase. A _bore_. The truth is this game showed the ineptitude of a broken Heat squad and the inconsistencies of these Celtics. Truthfully, as Celtics fans, we have to come to terms with the fact we have benefitted from injuries in the last two rounds. It hasn’t taken the Celtics’ best effort for 7 games to win a series, but who’s to say a Milwaukee squad with their 2nd best player lets the Cs get to game 7. More recently, Jimmy Butler has been two versions of himself this series. Pre-injury, in Games 1 & 2, Butler scored __41 & 29__ on a combined 62% from the field.  In Game 3, Butler had 8 points in 20 minutes before sitting out the 2nd half after getting injured. Games 4 & 5, the post-injury Butler, he has scored __6 & 13__ on __ 22% shooting from the floor. These low totals are certainly a by-product of the lack of support around Butler too. I mean seriously, look at that injury report. Someone needs to teach the Heat physics how to stretch a hamstring. And Tyler Herro, perhaps the most capable scorer coming off the bench in the league — a threat to drop 25 any night — missed a pivotal Game 5 and will probably miss Game 6 as well. Finally, Kyle Lowry — a certified Celtics Killer — contributed a __combined__ _14 points and 4 assists_ in the last 3 games; clearly a shell of his usual self. I remind you of all this to drive home the fact that a Celtics team with stars entering their prime still struggles for entire halves to score and ended the first half of game 5 down 5 to the skeleton crew Heat after committing 8 turnovers. We applaud them for a much improved 2nd half performance, outscoring the Heat 56-38, but honestly, its pitiful the product the Heat have had on the floor and the Celtics struggles versus it are borderline embarrassing. 

As for how the Celtics addressed our criticisms for Game 5, turnovers while Oladipo was on the floor were still an issue, and he came away with 2 steals; but at this point Oladipo deserves full credit for his defense and 1 or 2 steals a night isn’t worth the words anymore. As for being efficient with Rob Williams, 27 minutes is well above the 15-20 range we wanted to see, but I appreciate Ime keeping him in in the 4th to ensure there were no late game heroics by the Heat emboldened by his absence. The Celtics should have extra urgency to put Game 6 away early to get Rob an extra 2 days of rest should the Celtics win this series.

### Crazy Box Score Nugget from Game 5
The Miami Heat __missed 38 three-point attemps__ in Game 5, which is _only 1 shot less than the playoff record_ set by OKC in 2020. Many of them were taken without a defender making a legitimate contest. And the sequence of Victor Oladipo throwing up consecutive bricks from deep that over shot the hoop and hit the far side of the back board was as extraordinary as it was awful.

## What We Want To See In Game 6
### More Offball Action for Easy Offense
The Celtics are fortunate to have 2 players (Brown & Tatum) with the capability to produce for themselves consistently. This doesn't often produce wins though, and the supporting cast needs to be involved. Adam Taylor (@AdamTaylorNBA on Twitter & Instagram) does a fantastic job highlighting strategic plays by the Celtics, and one of his most recent posts of the "Boston Celtics Ram Screen" has all the elements of Celtics offense at its most potent. Lets look at the play with the assistance of Taylor's breakdown.

To start, the ball is sent to Derrick White on the wing, where Horford clears through, forcing the defense to prepare for pick & roll action as well as presenting a dilemma for the off-ball Heat defenders: sink to the baseline exposing themselves to a 3 from a cross-court pass, or turn their back on their man and risk an easy bucket from a cut.

As you can see in this still, Taylor notes the action keeps the defense busy.

We see Brown coming across the baseline to run of the Grant Williams screen.

Now heres why I love this action. Brown hits the 3 under some pressure, but theres so much potential here for the Celtics even on a night the jumpers aren't hitting. If Brown shot fakes the defender into that contest, he could drive at Robinson then dump off to Grant in space. Its a 2-v-1 that should result in a great look every time. And if you think PJ Tucker slides in to muck up that action, Brown OR Grant can easily flick it to Tucker's man in the corner for a WIDE open Hordord 3. This puts the whole Heat Defense into rotation and any team in the league could get a high quality look off of. 

Huge thanks to Adam Taylor for providing the breakdown and letting us reference it here! Check out his stuff, it's well worth it.
