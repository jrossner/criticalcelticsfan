We would like to introduce a new section of our posts, “The 20/20” — in honor of the “hindsight is 20/20” saying — to review some keys to the prior game.
### The 20/20
Call Game 5 what you want. A rock fight. A defensive showcase. A _bore_. The truth is this game showed the ineptitude of a broken Heat squad and the inconsistencies of these Celtics. Truthfully, as Celtics fans, we have to come to terms with the fact we have benefitted from injuries in the last two rounds. It hasn’t taken the Celtics’ best effort for 7 games to win a series, but who’s to say a Milwaukee squad with their 2nd best player lets the Cs get to game 7. More recently, Jimmy Butler has been two versions of himself this series. Pre-injury, in Games 1 & 2, Butler scored __41 & 29__ on a combined 62% from the field.  In Game 3, Butler had 8 points in 20 minutes before sitting out the 2nd half after getting injured. Games 4 & 5, the post-injury Butler, he has scored __6 & 13__ on __ 22% shooting from the floor. These low totals are certainly a by-product of the lack of support around Butler too. I mean seriously, look at that injury report. Someone needs to teach the Heat physics how to stretch a hamstring. And Tyler Herro, perhaps the most capable scorer coming off the bench in the league — a threat to drop 25 any night — missed a pivotal Game 5 and will probably miss Game 6 as well. Finally, Kyle Lowry — a certified Celtics Killer — contributed a __combined__ _14 points and 4 assists_ in the last 3 games; clearly a shell of his usual self. I remind you of all this to drive home the fact that a Celtics team with stars entering their prime still struggles for entire halves to score and ended the first half of game 5 down 5 to the skeleton crew Heat after committing 8 turnovers. We applaud them for a much improved 2nd half performance, outscoring the Heat 56-38, but honestly, its pitiful the product the Heat have had on the floor and the Celtics struggles versus it are borderline embarrassing. 

As for how the Celtics addressed our criticisms for Game 5, turnovers while Oladipo was on the floor were still an issue, and he came away with 2 steals; but at this point Oladipo deserves full credit for his defense and 1 or 2 steals a night isn’t worth the words anymore. As for being efficient with Rob Williams, 27 minutes is well above the 15-20 range we wanted to see, but I appreciate Ime keeping him in in the 4th to ensure there were no late game heroics by the Heat emboldened by his absence. The Celtics should have extra urgency to put Game 6 away early to get Rob an extra 2 days of rest should the Celtics win this series.

### Crazy Box Score Nugget from Game 5
The Miami Heat __missed 38 three-point attemps__ in Game 5, which is _only 1 shot less than the playoff record_ set by OKC in 2020.
