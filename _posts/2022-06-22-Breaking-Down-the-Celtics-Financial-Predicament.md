The 2022 Offseason is upon us, and if you watched the Finals, you probably came to a couple of conclusions like most fans:  
1) The Celtics played terribly in Games 4, 5 & 6  
2) The Celtics went on long cold stretches each game  
3) The Celtics are turnover prone – they shoot themselves in the foot 

So the Offseason brings the Cs the opportunity to address those issues, and sure-up a team that is now absolutely expected to return to the Finals. Anything less would be a disappointment. Besides a healthy Milwaukee team, and Brooklyn making a Kyrie trade, every other matchup in the East should be considered an upset if they topple the Celtics in 7 games. Let’s look at the Celtics current financial situation, and prepare ourselves for the offseason by getting to know the basics.

A huge thanks to [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/cap/?ref=trending-pages) for providing info on the Celtics' Salary Cap and Contracts.

## Guaranteed Contracts for 2022-2023 
The 2022 NBA Salary Cap is projected at $123.6 million (as of June 29th), but teams can spend up to an additional $27 million on retaining their players before being hit with the luxury tax.

Let’s look at which cap hits are already locked in for 2022-2023
- Jayson Tatum ($30,351,780)
- Jaylen Brown ($28,741,071)
- Marcus Smart ($17,207,142)
- Derrick White ($16,892,857)
- Robert Williams III ($10,937,502)
- Daniel Theis ($8,694,369)
- Grant Williams ($4,306,281)
- Aaron Nesmith ($3,804,360)
- Payton Pritchard ($2,239,200)

That’s $123,174,562 in fully guaranteed cap space. Already over the salary cap.

## Partially guaranteed contracts for 2022-2023::
- Al Horford ($26,500,000) _$7,000,000 incentive for winning Finals is reportedly being guaranteed by Celtics despite loss_

That brings our guaranteed cap total to $149,674,562. Just above the luxury tax line. While the Celtics had success last year with a small rotation, they can’t play the season with only 10 guys signed. They will still need to find 5 guys to fill out their roster.

## Non-Guaranteed contracts for 2022-2023:
These guys are likely to be trade bait or cut-candidates to ease the tax bill. 

- Nik Stauskas ($2,193,920)
  - Becomes guaranteed July 15th, 2022
- Juwan Morgan ($1,815,677)
  - Team Option
  - Becomes guaranteed January 10th, 2023
- Malik Fitts ($1,752,638)
  - Becomes guaranteed September 1st, 2022
- Sam Hauser ($1,563,518)
  - Team Option
  - Becomes guaranteed January 10th, 2023

The only player here I sense any interest in retaining for his abilities is Sam Hauser, as the Celtics continue their quest for reliable shooters. Nik Stauskas will probably net them a 2nd Rounder from a contender with more cap space than the Celtics, and they would probably rather get a lottery ticket on a cheap rookie deal in the second round who might be a shooter than Nik Stauskas who is a known commodity at this point.

## Next
Wyc Grousebeck revealed in interviews this week that the Celtics are willing to foot a luxury tax bill to return to the Finals - a critical commitment from ownership that enables the Brad Stevens to consider legitimate difference makers instead of scrounging for blemished treasure. 

Next time, we’ll look at trade options for a cash-strapped team.

Go Celts.
