We’re keeping this one shorter – and hopefully sweeter – because the Celtics made the Warriors look simple in Game 3.

### One Highlight from Game 3
Warriors lineups with Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green, and Gary Payton II played a total of 8 minutes in Game 3. These are three of the top defenders on the Warriors, but they had a Defensive Rating of 135.3, meaning they gave up an average of 1.35 points per Celtics possession. Predictably, this group’s offensive rating was low as they theoretically sacrificed scoring for defense: they averaged 0.33 points per possession. This means the Warriors gave up a whole point on average for every pair of possessions.

The Celtics' offense, while still turnover prone, is doing its job against the Warriors’ defense.
### The Continuing Lowlight of this Series
In Quarters 1,2, & 4 this series, Celtics are 3-0 with an average margin of victory of 17.3

In the 3rd Quarter, the Celtics are 0-3 with an average margin of loss of 14.3

Will we ever figure out why the Celtics continually slip into some sort of lackadaisical trance coming out of halftime? Probably not. But there’s tons of evidence that they are repeat offenders, and combining that with the Warrior’s prolific offense in the 3rd, the recipe for any Warriors win is in the third frame. The Warriors’ offense is averaging just over 35 points in the 3rd, while the Celtics have managed 24,14, and 25 in the 3rd. The Celtics need to turn up the defense in the 3rd instead of trying to match 3s. A more competitive 3rd for the Celtics would have them easily closing this series in 5 or 6 games.

## The Work Ons
### Value Possessions
Turnovers. Move yourself on offense. 12 turnovers in a game isn’t horrific, but they tend to come in bunches leading to Warriors runs. Stay in control.
### Stop Bleeding the Clock Early
The Celtics have this awful habit of trying to run the clock out with 6+ minutes in the 4th with any sort of lead. I don’t mind making Tatum the Playmaker, but slowing the offense down, and starting the action with 10 seconds on the clock gives the Warriors a chance to catch their breath; not to mention the confidence boost from stopping a team that forced itself into a buzzer beater. Just keep running the sets. If there's 2 minutes left and you’re up 10+, then you can start dribbling it out. As long as you still commit on the defensive end, of course.

## Predictions
The Celtics should take Game 4. I expect the Warriors to take Game 5 at home, a victory of desperation which depletes the Warriors such that the Celtics secure the championship in front of their home crowd. 

Of course, all that changes if the Warriors even the series in Game 4. So I implore the Celtics, show the rest of the league this is no fluke; assert your dominance over the Warriors tonight. A complete 48 minute effort, then you’re one win away from immortality.

Go Celts.
