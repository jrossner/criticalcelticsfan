While Celtics players are (hopefully) getting healthy, specifically Rob Williams and Marcus Smart, we are taking a look at how both sides matchup in __these__ Finals. Not the 2017, 2018, or even the 2020 Finals.

We will look at how the players and coaches matchup, and try to work out whether the Warriors core’s experience & success on this stage is an advantage over the Finals-green Celtics.

### Comparing the Starting Lineups
These lineups assume health, and are taken based off playoff starting 5s thus far.

__Warriors Starting Lineup:__ <br>
PG - Stephen Curry <br>
SG - Klay Thompson <br>
SF - Andrew Wiggins <br>
PF - Draymond Green <br>
C - Kevon Looney <br>

__Celtics Starting Lineup:__ <br>
PG - Marcus Smart <br>
SG - Jaylen Brown <br>
SF - Jayson Tatum <br>
PF - Al Horford <br>
C - Robert Williams <br>

Let’s take a look at how these groups have performed in the playoffs so far:

</p>

What pops out to me is the Warriors, statistically, look like the veteran group: more efficient shooting and fewer turnovers. Not exactly what we saw from the Celtics in the last two rounds, who as a team routinely donated the ball to their opponents in traffic and chucked it up from deep.

## Predictions
Let's look at some predictions we have for this series. Not how many games or who wins, but some story lines we expect to see.
This breakdown is a work in progress, check back in a bit for more. Thanks!

## 1) Aaron Nesmith will be a significant contributor in multiple games this series. 

Specifically, he will provide more for the Celtics than Payton Pritchard.

</p>

Pritchard played just over 14 minutes a game in 71 regular season games, and almost 13.5 minutes per game in the playoffs. He has appeared in each playoff game.

Nesmith averaged 11 mins in 46 regular season games, and just over 3.5 minutes in 10 of the Celtics’ 18 playoff games. Mostly garbage time. 

So why Nesmith over Pritchard? It comes down to matching up on the defensive end, and the continued potential for him to help space the floor.

At 6’5”, Nesmith is a better fit on the defensive end than the 6’1” Pritchard, who teams routinely target. If Pritchard sees the floor outside garbage time, I would expect any number of warriors to have a field day posting him up and running him off screens. Nesmith has the length to help crowd the Warriors’ shooters, and is ultimately highly switchable for positions 1-4, potentially 5 when draymond green assumes the role. He showcased his potential for defensive contributions in Game 1 of the Miami series posting 3 blocks — including some highlight chase-downs — and a steal.

Offensively, fans love seeing Pritchard in the game. He has shown consistently he can make space with his dribble, and has a knack for knocking down jumpers when he has time to create a rhythm with his dribble. He’s even a great catch-and-shoot threat from 3, hitting 41.2% during the regular season. The biggest issue is his drives leave a lot to be desired. He only canned around 38% of his shots after taking the ball past the arc. In the postseason, if you’re not a threat to finish inside, teams will eat up your airspace and those 3s will have to start coming from even deeper.

Nesmith has certainly not had nearly as much success on the offensive end this season (27% from deep in regular season action, 62% on 2s) and has absolutely disappointed as the 3 & D guy he was drafted to be. But the Warriors rotation are undersized compared to the Celtics at almost every position, and having another, even modest, deep threat on the floor will give the Warriors pause before sending double teams at Brown & Tatum. The added benefit over Pritchard being the Celtics can have confidence they will be able to defend as well with Nesmith on the floor. If Nesmith can return to his 2020-2021 form (27% from three), he could easily provide a significant 7-15 minutes for multiple nights to the Cs.

Go Celts.
