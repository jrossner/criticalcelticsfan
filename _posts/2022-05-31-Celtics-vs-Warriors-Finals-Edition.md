While Celtics players are (hopefully) getting healthy, specifically Rob Williams and Marcus Smart, we are taking a look at how both sides matchup in __these__ Finals. Not the 2017, 2018, or even the 2020 Finals.

We will look at how the players and coaches matchup, and try to work out whether the Warriors core’s experience & success on this stage is an advantage over the Finals-green Celtics.

### Comparing the Starting Lineups
These lineups assume health, and are taken based off playoff starting 5s thus far.

__Warriors Starting Lineup:__ <br>
PG - Stephen Curry <br>
SG - Klay Thompson <br>
SF - Andrew Wiggins <br>
PF - Draymond Green <br>
C - Kevon Looney <br>

__Celtics Starting Lineup:__ <br>
PG - Marcus Smart <br>
SG - Jaylen Brown <br>
SF - Jayson Tatum <br>
PF - Al Horford <br>
C - Robert Williams <br>

Let’s take a look at how these groups have performed in the playoffs so far:

What pops out to me is the Warriors, statistically, look like the veteran group: more efficient shooting and fewer turnovers. Not exactly what we saw from the Celtics in the last two rounds, who as a team routinely donated the ball to their opponents in traffic and chucked it up from deep.

This breakdown is a work in progress, check back in a bit for more. Thanks!

Go Celts.
