Let’s address the insult these Celtics continue to throw in the face of their fans.

These Celtics _do not value playing in front of their fans_.
## Let’s look at their performance through four rounds of the playoffs.
### Nets (Round 1)
The Celtics sweep round 1, all 4 wins by 7 points or less. Not much to gleam here, besides the fact that they show they are capable of winning at home and on the road. Let me know if you think this is actually proof my point here is mute or if the Nets were just that bad.

This is the only round the Celtics take two consecutive games in Boston. Even when there's away games in between.
### Bucks (Round 2)
The Celtics drop the first game at each venue and take the second game at each venue to even the series at 2-2. They drop game 5 in Boston before avoiding elimination in Milwaukee. The Celtics win Game 7 in Boston. Big win, no doubt about it. But the Bucks were hardly competitive after the first quarter in that game. The Celtics led the Bucks by 15 at the end of the 3rd quarter, and the Bucks only sank _ __four__ of their __33__ shots from deep_. The Bucks were 33 of 90 from the field overall. Even Giannis’ 25-point, 20-rebound, 9-assist performance seemed quiet. I give the Celtics credit for closing them out, but did anyone feel great about their performance?
### Heat (Round 3 - Eastern Conference Finals)
The Celtics _again_ zigzag the first four games, dropping the first in each venue set and claiming the second. As a fan at this moment, you had to be asking yourself why being in Boston is not giving the Celtics a boost to take a series lead. The Celtics take game 5 in Miami, __and the whole world outside Florida is riding a Green High__. The Warriors were already waiting to host Game 1 of the Finals. The Celtics had nagging bumps and bruises that would benefit from an additional two days of rest. Here, on the Critical Celtics Fan Blog, we pleaded with the Celtics for urgency in closing out the series in Game 6. _And it’s in Boston_. Yet we see the Celtics come out slow against the Heat – falling behind by 7 at the end of the first quarter – then sitting back and hoisting threes in the final frame of a close game. Back to Miami, where the Celtics pull out a 4-point win despite offering up the game to the Heat in the final minutes of the game.

But they’re in the Finals. They’re four wins away from glory.  
Through three rounds, and 18 games, their venue record stands as:  
__Home:__ 5-4 <br>
__Away:__ 7-2 <br>
<br>
Just as many games at home as away, there’s an argument there that if the Celtics take one more game at home and there’s no argument that the Celtics are playing better on the road than at home.

But if these Celtics are as good as we believe them to be, having a winning record on the road should not really be impressive. And being almost .500 at home is a massive disappointment: you’re at home – where you should be comfortable – the Boston crowd has created a hostile environment for opponents, and you split games? By the way, the Celtics were 28-13 at home during the regular season, so don’t let anyone tell you this has been this season’s trend. And they were 23-18 on the road, nowhere near as great as they’ve been in the playoffs. 

Now looking at the first four games of the finals.
### Warriors (Round 4 - Finals)
Celtics steal Game 1 on the road, then take a 2-1 lead in Game 3 at home. They have a chance to go up 3-1 on a Warriors squad with a championship core. With enough cushion to drop a game 5 on the road and secure a championship on their home court in Boston, in front of their fans. A lively Boston crowd watched their team squander legitimate leads in the fourth quarter, and permit the Warriors to even the series 2-2. I want to say that the Warriors regained home-court advantage; but it is painfully clear that playing in Boston was never an advantage for the Celtics. 

When asked about the success on the road these playoffs, Celtics team members have talked about how being forced to come together on the road focuses them and brings out their best play. Great. Love the road encouraging chemistry. You can’t play your best in the comfort of your own home? Where you can sleep in your own bed and keep the same routing you’ve had for 41 regular season games and 11 more so far these playoffs?

The insult to Celtics fans has been the obvious lack of urgency and competitiveness this Celtics team has shown while playing at home, especially compared to on the road. If the Celtics win Game 5 in the Bay, I fully expect them to perform 10 times as well in GoldenState for Game 7 than in Game 6 in Boston.

I doubt these Celtics find additional motivation in the idea of winning a championship in Boston, instead of celebrating in a mostly-empty arena three-thousand miles away. Celtics fans should take issue with their team’s home performance. But what can they really do between now and the end of this series? Hope for the best?

Please don’t think we wouldn’t be out of our minds off winning a championship in Game 7 _in Oracle_, but this mental Celtics team absolutely plays differently at home in the playoffs: and not in a good way. It is absolutely absurd to be more confident in playing on the road than at home.

We’re strapping in for Game 5.  
Go Celts.
