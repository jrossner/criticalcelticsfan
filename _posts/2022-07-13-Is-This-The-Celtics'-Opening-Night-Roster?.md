After waiting for waiver periods to end and the league office to officially process transactions, the Boston Celtics’ roster has been upgraded since Game 6 of the Finals, and – scarily for 29 other teams in the league – there is still room for improvement.

### The Additions
The Celtics have officially signed Danilo Gallinari to a two-year deal (second year is a player option) worth around $6,479,000 in Year 1 per [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/boston-celtics/cap/). 

After appearing in 66 regular-season games for the Atlanta Hawks last season, Gallinari put up 11.7 points on 43.3% shooting, secured 4.7 rebounds, and occasionally created for his teammates with 1.5 assists in just over 25 minutes a game. If Gallinari can maintain his status as a three-point threat – he shot over 38% from deep on 4.5 attempts per game – Celtics fans will cheer for every minute he spends on the floor. While he wasn’t a primary ball handler for the Hawks, __he only averaged 0.6 turnovers per game last season__ and has never had more than 1.8 per game in a season, so there’s some comfort to be had in the veteran stabilizing hectic moments for the offense. All the questions about his defense are well warranted, but being surrounded by athletic wings with length, and an eager rim protector in Rob Williams III should help him hold up; Gallinari stands at 6’10”, with a __7’1” wingspan__ (per [Basketball Beacon](https://basketballbeacon.com/danilo-gallinari-player-profile-stats/)), so he has the tools to disrupt passing lanes and challenge shots, too.

The big trade acquisition, _so far_, was Malcolm Brogdon. Brogdon is entering Year 2 of a 4-year contract, paying $22,600,000 this year, and then $22,500,000 in the final two years (Spotrac). For Brogdon, half the battle to being a success will be being available. __Brogdon has not been available for more than 80% of his team’s regular season games since his rookie year in 2016-17.__ He managed 19.1 PPG on 44.8% shooting, 5.9 APG, and surrendered 2.1 Turnovers Per Game in his 36 appearances last season. After only making 31.2% of his 3-pt attempts last season, the Celtics are praying he at least returns to his career average of 37.6%.

Bottom line for Celtics fans, the Celtics addressed three primary concerns following their embarrassing Finals loss.

1. Better shooting from the perimeter  
2. More (and more secure) Ball-handlers  
3. Quality Depth

So what’s left to add?

### What’s to Come?
Every team wants to add talent, but who really can? Usually you need at least 2 things to make yourself an option: cap space and/or valuable assets.

#### Let’s revisit the Celtics’ cap situation.
The 2022-2023 NBA Salary Cap is $123.655 million, and anything over $150.267 getting hit with the luxury tax.

Since our last discussion, the C’s unloaded Daniel Theis, Aaron Nesmith, Nik Stauskas, Juwan Morgan, and Malik Fitts in their trade for Brogdon (only Theis & Nesmith had guaranteed money) and signed Luke Kornet to a 2-year deal ($2,133,276 in Year 1) and Sam Hauser to a 3-year deal ($1,637,966 in Year 1). We also now know Boston’s second round choice, J.D. Davison, will play out the season on a Two-Way contract (__meaning his salary doesn’t count against the cap__); but at least we can expect to see him on the bench for a few regular season games at the minimum.

It’s still unconfirmed if Al Horford will get the full $26.5 million guaranteed for this season, but assuming it is, the Celtics’ active roster has 12 guys with guaranteed contracts that total $170,026,077. It’s practically unheard of for a team to only carry 12 men on its active roster, so at a minimum we should expect two more signings as roster filler. 

#### That Trade Exception You Keep Hearing About
The obvious move remaining for the Celtics is to use the trade exception created by the Evan Fournier trade to the Knicks. 

_”What exactly is a trade exception?_”, you may ask. In the NBA, if a team completes a trade in which they unload more salary than they take on, they are awarded a credit for the difference in salary, which they can use within the next year to acquire more salary. Simply but in the C’s case, they gave up $17,142,857 in salary (the value of Fournier’s contract that year) on August 17th, 2021 in exchange for two 2nd-round picks, so they have until August 17th, 2022 to use that $17.1 million credit. They could be on the other end of a similar trade in which they give up some 2nd-round picks for a player on a similar sized contract – I’m still holding out for a Marcus Morris return ($16.4 million this season) – or they could use the exception on a team looking to unload their roster filler or a cheap player unhappy with playing time; or simply let the exception expire. 

__Bottom line__, we should expect the C’s to use the exception as it allows them to acquire talent in exchange for minimal assets (assuming the trade partner is willing), which is a happy medium for fans begging for roster upgrades without relinquishing any young or – in Horford’s case – pivotal leadership.

We’ll see what Brad Stevens and Co can pull off in the next month.

Go Celts.
