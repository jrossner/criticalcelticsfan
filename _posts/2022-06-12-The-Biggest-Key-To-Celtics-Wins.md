The Celtics return to Oracle with the series tied 2-2. They have forfeited the home-court advantage they held after winning Game 1. Celtics fans are still waiting on Jayson Tatum to show his scoring prowess after a 4th quarter collapse in which both the offense and defense looked inept.

If your struggling with the dilemma of pleading with Tatum to takeover and writhing in pain from watching a stagnant offense, here's some proof the Celtics are far better off creating for each other than living or dieing by their stars' talent to creat for themselves.

The Celtics recorded 22 assists in their Game 4 loss vs the Warriors. 22 is far from pitiful, but the Celtics very clearly have struggled when hitting this mark or lower:

</p>

That's winning a measly 42.3% during the regular season (63.0% for entire regular season) and 37.5% in the post season (63.6% for entire playoffs).

Now looking at when they do a better job creating for each other:

</p>

When hitting 23 assists or better, they won 71.4% of their regular season games, and 78.6% of their playoff matches.

When hitting 25 or better, they won 74.4% of their regular season matchups, and 90% of their playoff games.

__The message is clear for these Celtics: Move the damn ball!__

Go Celts.
