In Round 2 versus the Bucks, the Celtics zigzagged through the series until Game 7 with the form: LWLWLWW  
In Round 3 versus the Heat, so far the Cs have continued: LWLW — Will this change in G5?

### Celtics Tailwinds
Coming off a 20 point win — that felt like a larger blowout — in which they held the Heat to 82 points despite missing their DPOY, the Celtics should be feeling confident in their ability to suppress the Heat’s offense. Derrick White showed an admirable level of aggression in creating offense in the first quarter of Game 4. Celtics fans should feel more comfortable about giving Smart another game to let swelling go down in his ankle with White playing this way. Especially if Payton Pritchard continues to make significant contributions off the bench (11.25 PPG, 3.25 APG this series including a 3 pt, 4 ast clunker in a 13 minutes Game 3 clunker). Finally, Rob Williams’ presence undeniably scares the Heat; more on that later.

### Celtics Headwinds
The Heat were missing Tyler Herro in Game 4, and if he takes the floor in Game 5 he is a game changer for the Heat. He is one of the few dangerous Heat shooters that doesn’t crater their own defense.  A hobbled Jimmy Butler looked like a shadow of himself as he stumbled through 27 minutes; if the day off and a night in his own bed let him regain his Game 1 form, the Celtics should leave their wallets at home because they’ve been mugged every minute a healthy Butler is on the floor; speaking of which, my biggest fear for the Celtics is that Victor Oladipo is finding his 2018 self against the C’s. Oladipo made the All-NBA Third Team, All-Defensive First Team, All-Star Team, and led the league in steals in 2018. He’s four years and a couple terrible knee injuries removed from being a top 30 NBA player, and in Game 4 he looked the most explosive I’ve seen since going down. Some may view his 23 points on 44% shooting and 6 assists in G4 as garbage time production, but NBA guards are products of confidence (see __Ben Simmons__), and Oladipo and Butler could be a formidable duo tonight.

### Crazy Box Score Nugget from Game 4:
Of the 12 Heat players that saw action in Game 4 (None less than 5 mins), only three players made it to the free throw line for a total of 14 attempts. Adebayo went 3 for 5, Martin went 0 for 1, and Oladipo hit 5 of 8. Compare those 14 to the Celtics hitting 32 of their 38, and that’s what we call a disparity. I wouldn’t expect those numbers to flip-flop in Miami, but in Game 1 Miami took 34 to the Celtics’ 32 and in Game 2 the Heat took 22 to Boston’s 23. 

### Something to Keep An Eye On
That injury report. There are rumors a couple of Heat players stayed in Boston (COVID issues?). This could be the break most Finals contenders get before making it to the championship.

## What I Want to See from the Cs

### Be Efficient with Rob Williams
Rob Williams has forced a Heat team that loves to drive to the basket to explore other options. But only when he’s on the floor. The need to keep Rob healthy for the rest of these playoffs while prioritizing winning now has been poorly managed by Boston staff. I want to see him play 15-20 mins max tonight barring a close game with 6 minutes left. He’s most effective when he’s explosive, and he’s clearly not in mid-season shape any more. Let his presence linger in the Heat players’ minds and then play small. 

### Clutch Your Pearls Around Oladipo
Oladipo had 7 steals in the first 3 games, before leaving empty-handed in Game 4. Game 4 was a product of being the offensive center-piece and the Celtics not feeling pressure to score in game 4 after jumping out to a big lead early; they had time to make safe decisions and go away from Oladipo, and even attack the version of Butler we saw in G4. I seriously doubt this inconsistent Celtics team will jump out to a huge lead in Miami tonight, and when Brown and Tatum are feeling the pressure of scoring they are likely to get stripped by Oladipo some more. If Marcus Smart isn’t available, the C’s likely become even more turnover prone in a competitive game. Best advice? Put Oladipo in the pick-and-roll early and at the top of the key where he can’t use court boundaries to trap the Cs. Or just have the Jay not guarded by Oladipo handle the rock to start the offense.
