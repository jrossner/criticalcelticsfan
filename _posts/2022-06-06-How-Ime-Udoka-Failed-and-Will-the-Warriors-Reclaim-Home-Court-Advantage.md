The Celtics-Warriors Finals is tied at one-game apiece. Some will say the Warriors have the momentum advantage, since they won Game 2, and don’t forget it was a _blowout_. Others would rebuke this notion with the Celtics’ momentarily stealing home-court advantage, and considering they’re undefeated after a loss this postseason, signs point to the Celtics retaking the lead in Game 3. One thing is clear for both sides: the version of the Celtics on the floor in the second half of Game 2 doesn’t stand a chance against these Warriors.

## Crazy Box Score Nugget
Jayson Tatum, 1st-Team All-NBA and All-Star (replacement) Starter, was a _-36 in 34 minutes on the floor last night_. __That’s the worst mark of his career and an NBA Finals record__. Defensively, Tatum came away with 1 steal, and only got called for 2 fouls; so it’s not like he was playing defense with fouling out on his mind. Offensively, despite an efficient start, Tatum ended 8-19 from the field, and 6-8 from the charity stripe for a total of 28 points – nothing to scoff at – but was buoyed by three-point success in the first half. He was 2-10 inside the Arc, finishing 2 of 7 from in the paint and missing all 3 midrange shots from roughly the same spot a few feet to the side of the left elbow (map below). Unlike Game 1, Tatum couldn’t offset his cold shooting with playmaking: He donated 4 turnovers and only 3 assists.

## Did the Cs Address Game 2 Work-Ons?
### Jordan Poole
Poole got going. Not what any Celtics fan wants to see from a pivotal bench player as a series with at-least 3 more games continues. 5-9 from deep, including back-to-back deep bombs to end the third quarter. The last one a __39-footer__. Those 6 points killed any hopes the Celtics had of making a similar comeback to Game 1, as the home crowd drowned out any rah-rah Udoka could have tried to give, and pushed the lead to 24; that 20 point mark seems to dictate in many NBA games when the trailing team gives up completely. Draymond Green noted last night that he was surprised by the Celtics pulling their starters early in the 4th, but in retrospect I appreciate the rest for the starters as they never looked like they had it in them to even _try_ to make a run. 

### How Would the Warriors Play Tatum
There were a few possessions early when we saw the Warriors commit to double-teaming Tatum, and he played his way out of it. However, for the rest of the game the second defender was clearly lurking near Tatum – and off their man – enough to make Tatum think. Tatum couldn’t punish his man in the second half and the Celtics’ offense looked way too stagnant; reminiscent of many Celtics games from the past couple years. Derrick White has shown some consistent motion, but the Celtics can’t simply clear out Tatum’s side on offense and watch like they have.

### Keep the Aggressive Drop
The Celtics kept the Aggressive Drop defense adjustment from Game 1, but still got burnt. This time from the inside. The Warriors scored 40 points from inside the paint. 

You may be thinking, “Well make up your mind. Do you want them to concede 3s or layups?”. Obviously neither is ideal, but my criticism is that the Celtics sent too many guys to contest a driving Curry, as he is a proficient passer, well capable of moving the ball between defenders. One play in particular stood out to me. As Curry made his way down the left-side of the key, 4 Celtics defenders were facing him with their backs essentially turned to their man. Curry dumped it off for an easy two. Something for Udoka to work out, deciding what rotation the Celtics should use there.

## Game 2 Qs
### Why did Jaylen Brown fade?
Brown came out aggressive and hot. He hit three 3s, a technical-foul free throw, and converted a 3-point play on an And-1 layup for a total of 13 points in the first 8 minutes of the game. After getting called for a bogus foul – his second foul of the night – on a Gary Payton layup, he was promptly subbed out. Brown missed his first 6 shots of the second quarter, before getting tangled up with Draymond Green after being fouled on an attempt from 3. I did not mind Jaylen pushing Green’s foot off his shoulder, or him talking back to Green. I was worried when Jaylen stood over him that the refs would take the game into their own hands, but they let it be; probably because Green already had a tech and there’s no way they could give it to Brown without giving one to Green. I thought a little confrontation with Green might fire Brown back up – that it might bring out the Jaylen glare, you know the one he gives before relentlessly driving to the hoop and punishing the defender that dares jump with him (something I wish he was triggered to do more easily) – instead he hit 2 of those 3 free throws, then a layup in Q3, to wow Celtics fans. He ended the game with 3 fouls; so like we said for Tatum, they weren’t even close to foul trouble. Why did they stop driving to the hoop, and playing physical defense? Sometimes a sign of fatigue is settling for jumpers, and Brown may have revealed he was tired, taking 9 threes, and 3 more shots from outside the paint (only 4 shots inside the paint). He went 5-17, and it felt like he front-rimmed most of his misses. Hopefully two nights off brings him back.

# Let’s Look at Game 3
## Warriors Worries
### Klay Thompson
Thompson’s first two games of this series have been duds. 

Game 1: 15 points on 6-14 shooting from the field, 3-7 from deep.
Game 2: 11 points on 4-19 from the field, 1-8 from deep.

I want to give the Celtics defense credit, as they certainly have done a good job sticking on Thompsons hip and sending size at him to prevent his sneaky-good post-ups, but Thompson is due for a hot night. Thompson was great shooting the deep ball in Round 1 vs Denver (22-48, 46%), but has struggled since, __except in close-out games__.

Round 2 vs Memphis:
Games 1-5: 12-40, 29.3%
Game 6: 8-14, 57%

Round 3 vs Dallas:
Games 1-4: 7-24, 29.2%
Game 5: 8-16, 50%

The obvious takeaway is should the Warriors get to 3 wins, expect Thompson to torch you from deep. But these moments also show that a Thompson-takeover is not a rare event, and we probably don’t need to wait for an elimination game for him to hurt the Cs. With the Celtics’ issues slowing down Curry and Poole, Thompson could be the trump card for the Warriors.

## Game 3 Work-Ons
### Udoka Needs to Control the Game
In the fourth quarter of Game 1 we saw Udoka use timeouts, even while the Cs were on a run, to set some plays, give guys a breather, and to reinforce the messaging on approach to the game.

When the Celtics got pummeled in Q3 of Game 2, Udoka only used one timeout. The full timeout was taken at the 9:21 mark, after the warriors had started the quarter on a modest 7-2 run to lead 59-52. I like this timeout, as the coaches tried to ice yet another hot start from the Warriors. By the 6:47 mark of Q3, the Warriors lead 68-56. There’s a scoring drought by both teams until the 4:58 mark. __ Through 7 minutes and 2 seconds of Q3, the Celtics have managed a meager 6 points to Golden State’s 16__. Finally, Grant Williams and Tatum hit back-to-back threes. A timeout in the next few possessions here would have been great. The lead is down to 6. 

Instead, Golden State goes for their “killshot” run. Otto Porter Jr. hits a 3, then Green converts two free throws before Curry hits two 3s in a row. __Now the lead is 17__. Tatum takes back-to-back trips to the line and misses the first, hits the second both times. Poole goes on a run, gifting Looney a layup before hitting two monster threes. __The lead is up to 23__. 

__It is absolutely unacceptable for Ime Udoka to let the game get out of hand like this in the span of _just 5 minutes___. Udoka can not take a backseat, this group of Celtics needs the coach to intervene when they’re sliding and focus them when they’re on a run. The Celtics offense was desperate for an easy bucket. After the timeout taken, the Celtics hit 2 threes, 1 paint shot, 1 midrange, and 4 free throws the rest of the quarter: two of those free throws came on the Celtics possession after the timeout. That’s awful.

### Match the Fire
This ones simple. The Celtics have fire when they’re the front runners, but that’s easy. Game 2 was an exhibition by Draymond Green on how to fire your team up with physicality. Each team got T’d up Sunday Night. Green for taking Grant Williams to the mat early on, and Udoka for over-verbalizing his frustration in Q3. Clearly, Draymond’s set the tone early. He also tied up Horford on the opening possession, and continued to make life difficult for the Celtics in the paint all night. 

Nothing less should have been expected from a desperate veteran team facing an 0-2 hole going on the road in the Finals. The Celtics need to find that grit to take a commanding lead at home Wednesday Night.

### Protect the Rock
Does this rote at this point? The Celtics got mugged 15 times by the Warriors to compile 19 total turnovers. They were fortunate enough to only give up 15 points off those 19 turnovers. The Celtics cashed in on the Warriors’ 12 turnovers (5 stolen) for 33 points. The Celtics should be commended for that, but know that this Warriors team loves those transition 3s and 19 turnovers is asking too much of your defense.

Go Celts.
