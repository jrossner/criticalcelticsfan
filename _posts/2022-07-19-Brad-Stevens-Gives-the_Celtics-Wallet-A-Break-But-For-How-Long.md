The deadline for using the Evan Fournier Traded-Player-Exception has passed, and the Celtics roster sits at 12 official players and 2 two-way players. NBA “teams are required to have 14 players on their rosters (not including two-way players)”, so we know the Celtics are required to sign at least two more players before the regular season starts ([CBABreakdown.com](https://cbabreakdown.com/other-notes)). 

The most likely move seems to be that Brad Stevens fills those spots to start the season with minimum-contract guys that show competence during this stretch between summer league and preseason in Celtics’ workouts. During the offseason, NBA teams may carry 20 players on their roster, so most teams cut five players then assign them to their G-league affiliate, possibly award them a two-way contract, or simply let them pursue other opportunities. The Celtics could poach these released players - but for most young players trying to establish a presence in the league, the prospect of sitting on the end of a deep roster is far from tantalizing. It does present the opportunity to grow in practice and possibly witness a deep playoff run, but for guys desperate for financial security this is not usually a high priority.

The less likely scenario - which Celtics fans will hold their breath for - is that Stevens works out a trade or two of the following forms:
Send out one better player, receive two lesser players
Send out draft pick(s) or cash considerations, receive a player
Package a player (think Kornet or Hauser) and draft pick(s) for multiple players (likely of same talent level)

Or the Celtics sign a free agent. Celtics’ management has indicated they are willing to spend for a championship, so expect Stevens to be more fiscally efficient with any additions he makes this summer than he was previously.

### Possible Free Agents the Celtics Could Sign
These players address concerns with the Celtics roster from last season, and that likely would join a title-contender for less than $10 million/year. Think 1-2 year contracts with a player option in the second year, incentivizing players with security if they don’t have the season they think they are capable of, or to capitalize if they do play well.

Top 3 Free Agents remaining for the Celtics to sign: 
- Jeremy Lamb
- Markieff Morris
- Ben McLemore

Let’s take a look at why these guys fit our criteria:

#### Jeremy Lamb

__Note__: While Miles Bridges and Montrezl Harrell are established NBA talents – that are free agents – that the Celtics roster would be better with, we will not consider them due to legal issues, and the high likelihood they would earn sizable contracts if any team signs them.

Go Celts.
