First off, I _pray_ Grant Williams sees this. The man needs to hear from Celtics fans just how aggravating he is. And I know Grant is undoubtedly a better basketball player and has a higher basketball IQ than me. But Grant’s ballooning ego has become apparent over the last 3 months and we are tortured with watching him do impressions of his star-level teammates to the Celtics’ detriment. As much as Marcus Smart gets flack for projecting himself as a star, Grant should receive more.

Let’s rewind to after a 124-104 win over the Denver Nuggets on March 20, 2022. Grant Williams puts up an admirable 13 points on 50% shooting, secures 6 rebounds, and blocks 2 shots in 27 minutes off the bench. The best part of his performance was being a significant reason the Celtics were able to “hold” the reigning MVP, Nikola Jokic, to a modest 23 points and 4 assists. Grant Williams takes his credit and tells the media he asked his teammates to call him “Batman” from now on; a play on Jokic’s “Joker” nickname. The moment is good for a laugh – especially Brown and Tatum’s responses – and a confident bench player, who has flirted with leading the league in 3-point percentage this season, can be a series-changer in the playoffs. He finishes the season averaging 7.8 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.0 assists on 47.5% shooting and 24.4 minutes per game. A legitimate rotation player poised to contribute to a hot team ready to make a playoff run. 

In their first round sweep of the Brooklyn Nets, Grant averages just over 11 points and 4 rebounds while joining in on the harassing defense that perplexes Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving; he blocks a total of 6 shots vs the Nets! Then the Celtics move on to face the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, led by one of the most athletic 7-footers to walk the earth: Giannis Antetokounmpo. Every Celtics fan knows Grant will be critical in building the defensive wall against Giannis. Grant surprises everyone with a 21 points (6-9 from deep) performance in Game 2 that keys a 109-86 victory. So far his performance in the playoffs has been commendable. The one thing this Celtics team does consistently that starts to get under the skin of fans is throw their hands in the air and harass the refs on every call or non-call against them. The most egregious offenders – Daniel Theis for calls and Jayson Tatum for non-calls – either consistently were wrong in their complaint (Theis) or indirectly gave up easy baskets to their opponents by hanging out with the refs instead of joining their teammates on defense. 

And then Grant Williams begins to vie for the leaderboard in complaints. Perhaps he is perplexed the refs aren’t up-to-speed on his defensive reputation, but the variety of looks his face portrays and the mobility to raise his shoulders that high in apparent shock at the refs’ calls is truly impressive (/s). As Celtics fans, we see him argue calls he’s obviously guilty of, and you soon start to lose all sympathy for Grant even when he has a point. The way he grabs the ball and hand delivers it to the ref to sneak in extra complaints; the way he crowds the refs’ airspace and gets in their face – and looks like he spits as he scolds the refs – you almost wish they would give him a Technical Foul to shut him up. As the Bucks series goes on, we start to see him take shots you’d question from Brown or Tatum most nights; side-step 3s, dribble pull-ups from midrange, even off-balance jumpers as more-open teammates sit ready to bail him out. 

__Side Note:__ Remember Guerschon Yabusele, the 6’8” forward from France that garnished the Celtics bench from 2017-2019? You might remember him by his nickname “The Dancing Bear”. He was surprisingly agile for his 270-pound frame. I bring you down memory lane to say Grant (6’6”, 236 per [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/willigr01.html) bears similarity in movement albeit less fluid. Keep an eye on it in Game 7, it’s worth the comparison.

Back to the Bucks series. His shot profile is now out of his depth, every night he’s doing a disservice to the Celtics’ chances of getting sympathy from the refs. I would expect the refs to actively try to foul him out at this point. He had 5 fouls in three games of the 7-game series, so maybe they were. But in a Game 7 start, he pours in 27 points, and is a +25 in 40 minutes as the Celtics win 109-81, and advance to the Conference Finals. If I told you to guess the Celtic player who took 18 threes in a Game 7, how many attempts would you take to guess _Grant Williams_? The man now is an irritation to watch on your own team, but to his credit is having bright moments. My issue with Grant is that I believe this moment is pivotal in him losing all sense of his role on this team. Grant Williams taking 22 shots in a game should never happen again in his career. Again, to his credit, this Miami series he hasn’t gone wild jacking shots up: he’s taken (in order) 5, 7, 6, 8, 5, and 2 shots in the first 6 games. 

But his persistence arguing calls, embellishing contact, and theatrical disagreement with the refs reached a tipping point in Game 6. He runs around the court after calls. He goes forehead-to-forehead with the refs arguing, props to them as they ignore him and his highschool intimidation tactics. Even when he’s silent, he’s infuriating, as he stares down referees. Give him a tech. Give him two! Give him the goddamn reality check he needs.

Grant Williams, you are not a star player – nevermind a star defender – in this league. You can be a valuable, quality role player, who steals occasional games for the Celtics, who we would PRAISE for a few 20 point games a year. Who would have a _cult following_ if he could play his brand of defense while only arguing a quarter of the calls he does now. 

Grant, if you are half as smart as the astronauts you aspire to be, you would watch the film and recognize you can benefit from playing with two stars (the Jays) and big men (Al & Rob) that create wide-open shots for their role guys. Set your screens, find the open 3-point spot, pass the ball when your shot isn’t there, tone-down the noise to the refs, and take the $2.6 million you make this year as a late first-round pick to the bank. On this team, if you embrace your role there could be a championship this year or next. You average 10 points as a 38%+ 3-pt shooter for a championship contender, under 25 years old, __You will get $12+ million/year contract offers or more!__. It’s that simple.
At some point, we need Ime to get to Grant. Whether it’s setting an allowance on complaints or pulling him out of the game when he starts running his mouth. It has to change. Celtics fans are ashamed of the theatrical baggage that accompanies his performance. Especially when it’s more noteworthy than his production. We are pleading with you, Grant Williams, be _Grant Williams_. Not an impression of an NBA star. Play within yourself.

Embrace your role. Be the defender that scorers try to get switched off them. Be confident in your shot when you’re set up. When the refs get calls wrong – we know they will get at least one wrong every night – just look at your teammates and know they trust you to make the right play. Look at the Celtics fans and know they admire you more for accepting the adversity and moving on to the next play than some role guy arguing every little call. Less is more, Game 7, let’s see it.

Go Celts.
