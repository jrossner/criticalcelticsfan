If Game 2 left you as dazed and confused as the Miami Heat seemed to be, here’s a quick breakdown of the Celtics’ overpowering performance in Game 2 of the ECF.

Offensively, Game 2 was a Celtics Shooting Showcase
- 51.2% on 84 shots from the field overall
- 50% on 40 shots from the 3-point range
- 91.3% on 23 chances from the free throw line

Defensively, the Cs racked up
- 5 blocks — R. Williams (3) 
- 8 steals — M. Smart (3)
- but only managed to grab 33 of 52 possible defensive rebounds from the Heat.

And Introducing a new segment I’d like to add going forward (_drum roll please …_)
### Crazy Box Score Nugget:
The Celtics had three players register Plus/Minus scores of 30 points or more:
- P. Pritchard +39
- G. Williams +37
- M. Smart +31

For those who aren’t familiar, the Plus/Minus score of a player measures the difference in points scored by the player’s team and points scored by the opposing team while the player is in the game. Typically, a player recording a score over 15 is great; over 30 is remarkable and evidence of a blow out.

### Something To Keep An Eye On
After playing through a leg injury sustained in Game 1 of the ECF, PJ Tucker left Game 2 after playing 22 minutes and suffering a left knee contusion. Tucker has maintained his reputation as a corner-3 threat and reliable defender. As any victim of a contusion can attest, an athlete’s explosive ability is severely reduced and they must endure the dull pain and sensitivity to further trauma. While Tucker is not known as an explosive NBA athlete, sitting in that defensive stance while bumping with Tatum, Brown, or Horford sounds awful.

## And now to the criticisms of the Celtics routing of the Heat.

### Clean Up On the Boards
As mentioned above, the defensive rebounding looks bad in the boxscore —I would rip a 63% def. rebounding rate if this had been a 10-point win or worse — but teams playing with huge leads typically relax on the defensive end. Still, teams know they catch the Celtics lacking on the defensive boards, and with both Al Horford AND Robert Williams playing together, and the star duo Brown and Tatum standing at 6’6” and 6’8”, the standard for rebounding should be higher. 

### Tatum Turnovers
Tatum _only_ gave up 3 turnovers in Game 2; an improvement from the 7 he coughed up in Game 1. But I am still concerned with the high number of turnovers he has been giving up in the playoffs: 6 each in Games 3 & 4 vs the Nets, and 6 in Game 7 vs the Bucks. While certainly a product of being the offensive focal point in the playoffs during a string of injuries, turnovers versus the Heat are almost sure to be converted, every extra turnover could make a huge difference in momentum and score for more tightly contested games.
