We are Boston Celtics Fans. Have been for decades. We cheer for our team to win every game, we go into every game knowing they could. But we like to think critically about whats going on with the Celtics at every level. 

We hope you enjoy out content, and maybe even find something new to think about from us. We love discussion, please share your thoughts -- whether you agree or disagree -- on any of our platforms.

Thanks for your support!
